Been working on attempting to do some physics, *been* kind of a struggle though...
Back in the day (20 years ago), I remember seeing TONS of various tutorials on physics and particle simulations, what happened?

Maybe it's just my Google-foo failing me.

I did this with the help of:

Yeah, ChatGPT was actually pretty helpful on this.

Of course it's not perfect, with the 200 circles piling up under gravity alone, they tend to... Compact into each other, not really sure why.
But it's still a WIP, like pretty much anything I do. lol
